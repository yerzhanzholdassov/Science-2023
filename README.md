# Acceleration of Diels-Alder reactions by mechanical distortion
---
We have exploited elastomeric tip arrays to apply uniaxial stress to drive organic reactions. Experimental and theoretical studies have been implemented.  

## Description of the data and file structure
Here, all tables from the manuscript are included. 
Table S1 contains the experimentally determined dependence of force and pressure on feature length.
Tables S2-S6 contain experimentally obtained feature intensity values.
Table S7 provides information on reaction rate constants.
Table S8 provides activation energy and activation volumes for 4 different reactions.
Table S9. The change in free energy of activation (ΔΔG‡) at every pressure for each dienophile-anthracene pair.
Table S10. Bending angle, θ, and percentage of applied force, Fn/Fz, for different pressures and oxygen bond configurations.
Table S11. ΔEs in kJ∙mol‒1 of reaction as a function of the bending angle of CCH. 
Table S12. ΔEs in kJ∙mol‒1 of reaction as a function of the bending angle of SiCC. 
Table S13. ΔEs in kJ∙mol‒1 of reaction as a function of the bending angle of OSiC. 
Table S14. Degree of asynchronous TS, defined as a difference between the distances corresponding to the forming bonds, as a function of the CCH bending angle. The positive values indicate that the C atom closer to the silica cluster is closer to the anthracene ring.
Table S15. Differences (in kJ·mol-1) between the activation energy of the relaxed reactants and transition state, and the ΔEs predicted using varying two angles independently (two independent variables) and simultaneously (two coupled variables).
